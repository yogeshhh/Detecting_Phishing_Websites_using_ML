# Troubleshooting
This document will help you check for common issues and make sure your issue has not already been reported.

## Check to see if the issue has been reported
* Search the [Issues page](https://github.com/rohitnaik246/Malicious-Web-Content-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning/issues) to see if someone else has already reported the same issue.

## List of things to double check
Please make sure of the following things -
* You are using Python 2.x for running the project. You can confirm this by entering the following command in the terminal - ```which <python-path-you-have-in-clientServer.php>```
(The project has been developed in Python 2.7 and due to certain differences in the syntax and the support of modules imported, the project works smoothly with Python 2.x as of now.)
* You have done a ```git pull``` before running. The project is being updated on a daily basis (as of May 2019) and making sure you have the most updated version of the project will resolve most issues.

## Create an issue
If your problem hasn't been solved or reported previously, and if you have followed all the items on the above list of things to check, then create an issue:
1. Select a template closest to the title of the issue you want to file.
1. Enter the details specific to the template.
